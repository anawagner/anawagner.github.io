title: About Ana Wagner
---

I am a software engineer. I enjoy solving puzzles and creating usable
solutions through structured, modular, and maintainable computer
programs.

I strongly believe in lifelong self driven education. I also believe
in attachment parenting and have made my two young children a priority
for the last 6 years. I took a break from a career to take on the role
of full time stay at home parent.

My goal for the near future is for my children to have a largely
self-driven non-traditional education and for me to work full time
as a software engineer.
