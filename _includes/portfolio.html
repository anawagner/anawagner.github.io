        <p>I first learned CSS before the days of flexbox, grid layout,
            and responsive web design. After a long break from doing any work
            with CSS, I've updated my CSS knowledge through the
            MDN tutorials. I find MDN to be a great resource.</p>

        <p> I also creted this jekyll site with my own responsive layout.</p>

        <p>Here is something that demonstrates some CSS skill.<p>

        <p>I also can work with CSS preprocessors</p>
