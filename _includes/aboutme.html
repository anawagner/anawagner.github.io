    <article>
      <p> I am a stay at home parent who is skilled in software engineering.
         I enjoy logic and solving puzzles. My interests drove me to study
         Philosophy, Mathematics, and Computer Science in college. I also
         have worked in quality assurance in the technology industry.
         I am motivated by my desire to have meaningful work in providing
          solutions through structured, modular, and maintainable
        computer programs.</p>

      <p>I strongly believe in lifelong self driven education. Web Development
      is appealing to me because I can use my computer science and programming
      skills and continue to learn and update my knowledge in newer
      technologies.</p>
