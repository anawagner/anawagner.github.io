title: Welcome to Jekyll

Hello! This is the first post on my jekyll blog. I wanted to build a portfolio
page for my work. I wanted it to include a blog to encourage myself to
write about my learning process and to explain my projects in detail.

Since I have not done programming for many years I want to focus on only
the newest latest work I am doing. For now, my time is limited because
I am still taking care of my kids full time. But whenever I can
accomplish anything worth showing off I will add an entry here, taking
about it.

For this first project, I created a blank (no gem theme) jekyll site.
All of the html and CSS is my own. I am happy with the result. Though,
I would like to make it more sophisticated in the future.

Some of the things I'd like to improve:
* a more professional and appropriately sized profile
image.
* Improved site navigation to indicate what the current page is.
* Make better use of categories or tags to organize content.

Things that I have learned include: making a responsive html/css site,
using jekyll with layouts, and setting site defaults and variables,
templating with Liquid.
