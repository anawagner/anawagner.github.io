Hello! This is the first post on my jekyll blog. I wanted to build a portfolio
page for my work. I wanted it to include a blog to encourage myself to
write about my learning process and to explain my projects in detail.

I have done little programming in recent years due to being a full time
parent. Instead of focusing on past projects (now more than 6 years old
  and difficult to locate!), I want to focus on the present and future.
For now, my time is limited because I am still taking care of my kids
full time. But I am using my spare time to learn new skills, refresh
old skills and to create! Though progress will be slow, it will happen!

For this first project, I created a blank (no gem theme) jekyll site.
All of the html and CSS code is my own and from scratch. I am happy
with the result. Though, I would like to make it more sophisticated in
the future.

Some of the things I'd like to improve:
* a more professional and appropriately sized profile
image.
* Improved site navigation to indicate what the current page is.
* Make better use of categories or tags to organize content.
* use sass to build a more maintainable theme.

Things that I have learned include: making a responsive html/css site,
using jekyll with layouts, and setting site defaults and variables,
templating with Liquid.
