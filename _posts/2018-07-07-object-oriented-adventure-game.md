category: code

My next project will be from MIT's online course for
_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. The project
is an Object Oriented Adventure Game. Some code is provided in
MIT scheme along with some assignments. The purpose is to be able
to read a large object oriented program and be able to understand it,
use it, and extend it.
