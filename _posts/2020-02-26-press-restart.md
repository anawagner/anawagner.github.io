title: A new "design"
category: code
---

I have updated my profile page for the first time in two years. It has a
new responsive "design."  I cannot say my design abilities are impressive
but I have tried to show that I am able to create a CSS layout from scratch.
I have used grid and flex layout techniques. I also used media queries and
mobile first design to make this page friendly for screens of all sizes.

The idea is to keep it clean and simple to showcase work as I complete it.
I am a full time parent and blessed to have a busy life! Though that means
that updates and projects will come slowly. I am working little by little
to refresh my knowledge and to show that my skills are not rusty and
outdated. Because of that I will not be taking old projects out of ...?
wherever they may be in storage if any of it has survived. I am happy to
start anew and look to the future instead of past accomplishments.
