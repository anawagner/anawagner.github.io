I"9<p>I am a software engineer. I enjoy solving puzzles and creating usable
solutions through structured, modular, and maintainable computer
programs.</p>

<p>I strongly believe in lifelong self driven education. I also believe
in attachment parenting and have made my two young children a priority
for the last 6 years. I took a break from a career to take on the role
of full time stay at home parent.</p>

<p>My goal for the near future is for my children to have a largely
self-driven non-traditional education and for me to work full time
as a software engineer.</p>
