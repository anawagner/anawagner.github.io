I"<p>I have updated my profile page for the first time in two years. It has a
new responsive “design.”  I cannot say my design abilities are impressive
but I have tried to show that I am able to create a CSS layout from scratch.
I have used grid and flex layout techniques. I also used media queries and
mobile first design to make this page friendly for screens of all sizes.</p>
