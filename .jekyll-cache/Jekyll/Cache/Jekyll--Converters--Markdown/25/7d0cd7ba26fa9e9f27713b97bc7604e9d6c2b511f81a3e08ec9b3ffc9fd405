I"=<p>I have updated my profile page for the first time in two years. It has a
new responsive “design.”  I cannot say my design abilities are impressive
but I have tried to show that I am able to create a CSS layout from scratch.
I have used grid and flex layout techniques. I also used media queries and
mobile first design to make this page friendly for screens of all sizes.</p>

<p>The idea is to keep it clean and simple to showcase work as I complete it.
I am a full time parent and blessed to have a busy life! Though that means
that updates and projects will come slowly. I am working little by little
to refresh my knowledge and to show that my skills are not rusty and
outdated so because of that I will not be taking old projects out of …?
wherever they may be in storage, we don’t want any dusty old work ;)</p>
